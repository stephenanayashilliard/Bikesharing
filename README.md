### Questions raised:
- Why is there a considerable drop in bike use for Wednesday afternoon/evening's rush hours when compared to other weekdays?
- Why is there a considerable increase in Thursday afternoon/evening's rush hour when compared to other weekdays?
- Why are males more likely to be subscribers than females?
- Why are the vast majority of "unknown" riders in their mid 50's?
- Why is here is a sharp uptik of subscribers in their mid 50's then a rapid decline of subscribers for those in their mid 40's?


### Further Queries
- Currently have no data on the gender of 5,699 riders. Recomend requesting gender identification from all users in order to verify market potential for female riders. 
- Graphic verifying number of riders using service for commute and or leisure.
- Graphic illustrating where each rider group is graphically based.  Is there a correlation between where riders live and or work?
