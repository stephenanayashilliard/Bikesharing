### Questions raised:
- Why is there a considerable drop in bike use for Wednesday afternoon/evening's rush hours when compared to other weekdays?
- Why is there a considerable increase in Thursday afternoon/evening's rush hour when compared to other weekdays?

### Further Queries
- Currently have no data on the gender of 5,699 riders. Recomend requesting gender identification from all users in order to verify market potential for female riders. 
- Graphic verifying number of riders using service for commute and or leisure.
